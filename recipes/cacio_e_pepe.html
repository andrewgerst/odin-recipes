    <h1>World's Best Cacio e Pepe</h1>

    <p> Cacio e Pepe literally translates as ‘cheese and pepper’. In this
        instance, the cheese is traditionally pecorino and the pepper is the ground
        black variety. These two ingredients are married together in a sauce
        cloaking a bowl full of spaghetti. </p>
    <p> It’s a remarkably simple dish of just a tiny handful of ingredients.
        The magic happens in the technique. I share my easy-to-master authentic
        Cacio e Pepe recipe below.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz bucatini or spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 tsp cracked black pepper toasted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Add a small handful of salt and pasta to boiling water.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 6-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta, reserving 2/3 cup of pasta water.</li>
        <li>Pour pasta back into pot or into a large skillet and place over low heat.</li>
        <li>Add pasta water and butter and toss together until butter just melts.</li>
        <li>Add grated cheese and black pepper and continue to toss together until cheese melts and a creamy sauce
            forms.</li>
        <li>Top with more grated cheese and serve.</li>
    </ol>
